          "SpoofCard has been a lifesaver so many times. I travel for work and
          my wife and kids are often home without me. Since my home address is
          connected to my personal number, I'll text through SpoofCard so
          clients and others can't get access to where I live."

          giving out my number to guys before I’m sure I want them to have it.
          SpoofCard lets me protect my number while still being able to send
          text messages to potential dates.”

          you want to send the message from and enter the number you want to

          to see the response in your account and continue the conversation.

        description: >-
          If the person you text calls the number the text came from, they will
          hear a recording that states the following: We're sorry. The phone
          number you've dialed is not accepting calls at this time. Please hang
          up and try your call again later.

          send the message from one of the numbers we offer.
      - title: WILL THE PERSON I TEXT EVER KNOW IT CAME FROM ME?
        description: >-
          The purpose of texting through SpoofCard is to give you easy access to
          a second phone number to use for business or personal needs. Since
          you'll be texting from one of our numbers though, you'll need to
          inform them since they won't know otherwise.
